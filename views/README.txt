How to create a View:

In the directory views (which this file is located) you can create a new folder. This folder needs to be your View name. In this new View (folder) you need to have 2 files: ingame.php and outgame.php. If this files do not exists in the folder you can enable the theme.

Optional files:

You can a optional screenshot for your theme. This need to be an png file and it's name need to be screenshot. So if you want the a screenshot of your theme you need to have the file in the root of your view and it need to be called screenshot.png.

You can also create as many directories or other files in your view if you want. For example you can create folders like: js, images and css.

Example:

For an example we take our default view "FrenzoTheme". In this folder we have two files called ingame.php and outgame.php. This file contain all the HTML. Also in this view we have multiple directory's like CSS, which contain al our CSS.
